### Hey there, I'm Martin! ðŸ‘‹

Recently received my BSc degree in Computer Science from the University of Surrey (UK).

Currently employed at Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust.

I would usually work on something that I deem beneficial for the world or a creative project for my personal enjoyment.
